## prototype-graphics-engine
Simple 2D graphics engine built in Java using javafx's JFrame widget for pixel-level control.

# to use
Run Main.java to see an example usage. This being a prototype, there is currently no command line or graphical interface to add entities to the screen. To change what entities are drawn, replace the code in Main.java using the code that is already there as an example.
